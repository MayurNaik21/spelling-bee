# Spelling Bee Game

## Introduction

Welcome to the Spelling Bee Game! This is a simple game where players guess a word spoken by the application. The game keeps track of the words you correctly guessed and provides feedback on your guesses.

This project was inspired by a similar application created by my mentor during my internship period. After observing the JavaScript and Bootstrap version of the app, I was encouraged by him to create a React-based version as a challenge to further my skills in modern web development frameworks. This project serves as an opportunity to apply my knowledge of React, Ant Design, and other libraries to build a clean and interactive user experience.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by clicking on the "Speak Word" button. The application will speak a random word from a list of words.
2. Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Check" button.
3. If your guess is correct, you will receive a success message, and the word will be added to the list of correctly guessed words.
4. If your guess is incorrect, you will receive an error message, and you can try again.
5. You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart Game" button.
